    <p>This is the first sentence.</p>

    <p>The United Kingdom has been a leader in the open data movement
    â€“ a new movement by governments around the world to open up the
    vast repositories of data they hold across agencies and
    departments, and to collect new kinds of data for public use. Open
    data is publicly available data that can be universally and
    readily accessed, used, and redistributed free of charge. It is
    changing the way governments, nonprofits, and the private sector
    use data to understand public issues and solve problems in areas
    as diverse as financial regulation, energy, education, and
    more.</p>

    <p>Open data holds particular potential in the health sector. By
    releasing health data and structuring it for usability and
    computability (all while protecting privacy) governments and
    healthcare organizations are betting on the power of open data to
    improve the quality of care, lower healthcare costs, and
    facilitate patient choice. The NHS has made and continues to make
    significant investments in open data. Over the past several years,
    it has launched a series of open data initiatives that have
    already had a positive impact on patient education, healthcare
    choice, healthcare costs, and patient outcomes. Now the NHS is
    planning a broader, more ambitious programme that has the
    potential to serve as a worldwide model for the use of open data
    in healthcare. The purpose of this report is to help design this
    programme, establishing priorities and ways of measuring impact so
    as to guide this and future efforts at data transparency.</p>
